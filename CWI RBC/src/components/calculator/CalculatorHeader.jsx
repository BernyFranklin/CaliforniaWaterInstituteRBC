      <h2>Water Recharge Basin Calculator</h2>
      <p>
        This calculator is intended to help farmers determine whether a recharge basin on or near their property is worthwhile. This tool provides only a preliminary cost estimate. Recharge basins should be professionally designed to reduce the risk of basin failure. Farmers should consult with your water district manager regarding the frequency of availability and cost of recharge water. At the moment, this calculator is still work in progress, and has been discussed at just one Technical Committee Meeting of the Water Blueprint. At the moment, the calculator assumes one basin on flat land.
